## About

I was born and raised in the southern Indian coastal city named Chennai (fondly called Madras). I am currently pursuing my doctoral studies under the supervision of [Prof. Henry D. Pfister](http://pfister.ee.duke.edu) in the [information iniative at Duke (iiD)](http://bigdata.duke.edu) group of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke University, Durham, NC, USA. Prior to this, I completed my Master of Science degree at Texas A&M University, where I worked on the construction of Cyclic Polar Codes. I was a graduate research intern during the summer of 2015 at Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs, Stuttgart, Germany, where I worked on the analysis of Spatially-Coupled LDPC Codes over burst erasure channels, under the supervision of [Dr. Laurent Schmalen](https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/laurent.schmalen) and [Dr. Vahid Aref](https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/vahid.aref). 

My general interests are in the realms of information theory, statistics and their applications. Recently, I have started looking into problems in the fields of compressed sensing, quantum information theory and quantum computing, and machine learning, specifically deep learning and its theory. I am a Student Member of the IEEE and the [Information Theory Society](http://itsoc.org).

I love pencil sketching and like to read about science, philosophy and life. I play cricket, volleyball and bowling. I am a novice writer and hope to disseminate productive thought and knowledge through this powerful platform called internet.
