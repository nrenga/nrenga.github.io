I am currently a tenure-track assistant professor in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Arizona](https://ece.engineering.arizona.edu/faculty-staff/faculty/narayanan-rengaswamy). I was born and raised in the southern Indian coastal city named [Chennai (fondly called Madras)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai). The [Greater Chennai Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Chennai_Corporation), established in 1688, is the second oldest in the world after London! 

Earlier, I was a postdoctoral research associate with [Prof. Bane Vasic](https://vasic-error-correction-laboratory.silicon-studio.com/index.html) here at the University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA. I completed my doctoral studies in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.duke.edu) at Duke University, Durham, NC, USA, under the supervision of [Prof. Henry Pfister](http://pfister.ee.duke.edu) and [Prof. Robert Calderbank](https://math.duke.edu/people/robert-calderbank) at the [Rhodes Information Initiative at Duke (iiD)](http://bigdata.duke.edu). <br/>
My dissertation is [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06834). 

Prior to this, I completed my Master of Science (M. S.) degree at [Texas A&M University](https://ece.tamu.edu), where I worked with [Prof. Henry Pfister](http://pfister.ee.duke.edu) on the construction of Cyclic Polar Codes. I was a graduate research intern during the summer of 2015 at Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs, Stuttgart, Germany, where I worked on the analysis of [Spatially-Coupled LDPC ensembles over burst erasure channels](http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08267), under the supervision of [Dr. Laurent Schmalen](https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/laurent.schmalen) and [Dr. Vahid Aref](https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/vahid.aref). My [Master's thesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06875) discusses cyclic polar codes as well as my internship work. Earlier, I completed my Bachelor of Technology (B. Tech.) degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering at [Amrita University, Coimbatore, India](https://amrita.edu).

My research interests are in the realms of information and coding theory (both classical and quantum), and general inference problems. Currently, I am primarily working on error correction schemes for fault-tolerant quantum computing, quantum networking and quantum communications. I am actively involved in projects for the NSF-ERC [Center for Quantum Networks (CQN)](https://cqn-erc.org), led by the University of Arizona, and the DoE-funded [Superconducting Quantum Materials and Systems (SQMS) Center](https://sqms.fnal.gov), led by Fermilab. I am a Member of the [IEEE](http://ieee.org) and the [Information Theory Society](http://itsoc.org).

I love pencil sketching and like to read about science, philosophy and life. I play cricket, volleyball, carrom board and bowling. I am a novice writer and hope to disseminate productive thought and knowledge through this powerful platform called internet. My old blog is [here](http://earthscitizen.blogspot.com).
